How does one pass time? For Americans, the phrase is synonymous with baseball. Growing up with the sport, however, we never played the game to pass time. A good game required pre-planning with at least a dozen friends and a bike ride to the local high school. Trading baseball cards passed time, catch passed time, but for the short-term minded adolescent, a full game is too much to ask.[^1]

Someone, Graham Green maybe, said that the best thing about baseball was that you could watch a game, and read a book at the same time, while not missing a thing in either. Hockey requires too much attention; American football has stoppages, but the play clock makes makes it difficult to focus on a single paragraph. For spectators, baseball is an excellent pastime. 

There's no baseball in Sierra Leone; I've failed to find even a game of cricket in this former British colony. For the small population of expats, there are ample opportunities for sports: hockey every Tuesday, a golf club off the lagoon, and water polo and rugby every Sunday.[^2] 

While there's no baseball, there is plenty of time to pass. Much of this is local: [as in many tropical countries](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28466), everything here moves slow, from the bureaucracy to the traffic. Some of it is personal. The slow and expensive internet inspired me to take up a [personal challenge](https://www.forourposterity.com/against-netflix/): since I arrived ten weeks ago, I have watched no shows or movies at all.[^3] These two factors resulted in a surprisingly large increase in my reading time. 

I was no slouch before; in 2020, I started just over 150 books and finished 65. Since I arrived in Sierra Leone, though, I have finished on average 4.2 books per week. It would be shame to leave all of them in my head. Here, I plan to outline  how I choose what to read, how I read, and why I'm writing about what I'm reading. For the first installment, click here.

## What to read

The reading list is the pinnacle of millenial blogging. Lists of finished books merge status seeking ("look how erudite I am!") with metrics ("I have finished on average 4.2 books per week"; what a fatuous thing to write) with catharsis ("I spent hours stuffing this information into my brain, now you spend 60 seconds absorbing what I learned"). This is why I love them so much. 

### The canon

> She was well acquainted with the heroes of Greece and Rome or with those of England who had lived some hundred years ago, while she was nearly ignorant of the passing events of the day: she had read few authors who had written during at least the last fifty years but her reading with this exception was very extensive.

Previously, I have in mind the late 19th century, most students at British or American universities had read the same twenty books. These were assigned through colleges, and subjected to thorough and deep study.[^4]

Today, there is much less overlap between what young people have read. Of course, we've all read *The Catcher in the Rye* and *The Odyssey* because we had to. But the canon has grown so large that, even when there is agreement on a certain author, only a very small fraction of readers will have spent any time with that author's books. Jane Austen, for example, is "in the canon", but if I know that I enjoy Thomas Hardy more, I will be better off doubling down on his work than trying *Persuasion* again.

With a massive canon at hand, how does one pick the classics worth spending time with? Reading lists! My favorites include:
* The canon of the canon is St. Johns College Great Books [reading list](https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/great-books-reading-list)
* Tanner Greer's [non-western canon](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/10/a-non-western-canon-what-would-list-of.html) provides names, not books, but this is even more useful for our purposes. For any historical author, it is easy to find lists on "where to start".
* Tommy Collison's [Great Books list](https://tommycollison.com/greatbooks), split into antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Enlightenment, and modernity. This is the list that has most inspired my classics reading over the past two years. 

When picking classics, I try to vary time and place. This is not so much to force diversity of thought as it is to avoid burnout — in March, I read the Henriad in a couple of days, and couldn't focus on anything else in iambic pentameter for two weeks. 

#### Aside: Why read the canon

https://twitter.com/merrilymaralie/status/1077223053917110272

I've never found a satisfying explanation of the value of reading classics. I read these because I enjoy them, which is perhaps enough. The St. Johns explanation is the most common, vaguely connecting the liberal arts to a life well lived. 

A more satisfying argument is probabilistic. Most of what people read, even setting aside news and current events, was written very recently. "Bestseller" lists demonstrate this — books pop up to the top upon their release (due to preorders), then fall down over time. Some classics reliably sell well (the bible, *Dream of the Red Chamber*, *Lolita*), but these are the exception. 

If you're looking for the best books to read, checking the NYT Bestseller list is exactly the wrong approach to take. Presumably there's some relation between the position and quality, but only at a snapshot in time. Is a "great" book more likely to have been written in the first three months of 2021, or between 1500 and 1750? 

Of course, there are other motivations in picking a book than just finding the best ones. The NYT Bestseller list is a Schelling point for what the educate, mid-Atlantic bourgeoisie are reading. If you want to have conversations with such people about books, it's reasonable to skim the top five books on these lists and walk into your neighborhood cocktail party.

This line of reasoning, however, also brings us back to classics. Many more people know that *King Lear* is a high-quality book than know *Caste* by Isabel Wilkerson has the NYT's stamp of approval (I just checked). Furthermore, the second knowledge is transitory. We can be relatively certain that the top non-fiction book on that list in six months will be something different, while *Lear* will not have budged in our common estimation.

The main category in which classics lose to modern boooks is direct commentary on current events. Take *Caste*. I haven't read it, but I've heard it discussed at a cocktail party. I have, however, read Ambedkar and W.E.B. Du Bois, and discussed the parallels between American racism and the Indian caste system with black and Indian friends. *Caste* (I assume) makes a valuable contribution to public discourse in putting these two systems next to each other for an American audience. 

I read classics for the same reason that [I don't read news](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/against-news/).
 
### Non-fiction

We know things now, and authors know things now, which we didn't know 200 years ago. Absorbing knowledge through Wikipedia articles is fine, 

The downside to non-fiction which kept me from reading anything but textbooks for a few years is the low information density of non-fiction books relative to journal articles and essays. Many non-fiction books would benefit from being half the length. 

> I have already made this paper too long, for which I must crave pardon, not having now time to make it shorter. (Pascal or Franklin or Twain)



## How to read

I read fast, but I don't read quickly. 

### Abandon most of what you read

Readers should abandon more books before one hundred pages. You'll have a good sense of how valuable the book will be, by this point, and whether it's worth the time investment. 

One exception is books that begin *in media res*. I tend to give up on these books far too quickly, which indicates either a deficit either in this literary device or my own patience. I'm currently enjoying a science fiction series *Terra Ignota* which begins in the middle of a death scene; it took me four tries to get past this first chapter. 

### Liberally skip paragraphs, pages, and chapters 

When you've read many books, you often know what's coming in the next book. Take *Thinking Fast and Slow* and *Predictably Irrational*, two popular books on biases. Both contain valuable ideas distinct from the other. But, if you've read one, you've also read about 60% of the other. By skipping everything but the new 40%, I can read faster. 

Intuitively, this effect compounds in the long term. At 24 years old, having only read a few hundred books, most of what I read is new to me. In a few decades, I expect to be not-reading much more. Investment costs are high and marginal returns are years away. 

This is most true for textbooks, very true for factual non-fiction, not very true for novels, and not at all true for poetry.

### Read comfortably

### E-books

In Freetown, if you go to the main market, you can find a few dozen stalls selling books in English. This is a fun experience the first few times, but becomes grating quickly. It's a long trip, they stalls rarely have anything new, and the owners will be most enthusiastic about selling you religious literature. As a result, most (about 70%) of my reading is on my Kindle, most of the rest is on my laptop, and a small portion on paper books I brought or bought.

[^1]: There was an abortive attempt by my dad to build a batting cage in my backyard when I was 13. We even got a [hand-fed pitching machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitching_machine#/media/File:Pitching_machine.jpg) off Craigslist or similar. The cage itself had structural issues, and I remember using it a couple dozen times in the ~four months it was up.

Even ignoring the Latin and Greek literature and language, the smartest people I know would have trouble with the math section (no calculators — they haven't been invented yet!).
